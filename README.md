# Description
Sometimes ideas die before they see the light of day, and some never even surface because their creators fail to find partners for their realization, don't receive support, or don't meet people ready to act. Our application brings together creative creators, ideas, and performers to enable the effective realization of young people's dreams and become a source of motivational and substantive support.
The main element of the application is an interactive map where users can browse profiles of people open to collaboration. The application offers three main functionalities:
- Communication with a mentor for development in the right direction.
- The ability to join existing projects or create new ones to expand knowledge and skills.
- Creating groups to participate together in IT-related events.
